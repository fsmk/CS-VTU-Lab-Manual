Lab Programs list for Analysis and Design of Algorithms Lab as specified 
by VTU for 4th Semester students:

1. Sort a given set of elements using the Quicksort method and determine 
the time required to sort the elements. Repeat the experiment for 
different values of n, the number of elements in the list to be sorted 
and plot a graph of the time taken versus n. The elements can be read 
from a file or can be generated using the random number generator.
2. Using OpenMP, implement a parallelized Merge Sort algorithm to sort 
a given set of elements and determine the time required to sort the 
elements. Repeat the experiment for different values of n, the number 
of elements in the list to be sorted and plot a graph of the time taken 
versus n. The elements can be read from a file or can be generated using 
the random number generator.
3. a. Obtain the Topological ordering of vertices in a given digraph.
b. Compute the transitive closure of a given directed graph using 
Warshall's algorithm.
4. Implement 0/1 Knapsack problem using Dynamic Programming.
5. From a given vertex in a weighted connected graph, find shortest paths 
to other vertices using Dijkstra's algorithm.
6. Find Minimum Cost Spanning Tree of a given undirected graph using 
Kruskal's algorithm.
7. a. Print all the nodes reachable from a given starting node in a 
digraph using BFS method.
b. Check whether a given graph is connected or not using DFS method.
8. Find a subset of a given set S = {sl, s2,.....,sn} of n positive 
integers whose sum is equal to a given positive integer d. For example, 
if S= {1, 2, 5, 6, 8} and d = 9 there are two solutions{1,2,6}and{1,8}.
A suitable message is to be displayed if the given problem instance
doesn't have a solution.
9. Implement any scheme to find the optimal solution for the Traveling 
Salesperson problem and then solve the same problem instance using any 
approximation algorithm and determine the error in the approximation.
10. Find Minimum Cost Spanning Tree of a given undirected graph using 
Prim’s algorithm.
11. Implement All-Pairs Shortest Paths Problem using Floyd's algorithm. 
Parallelize this algorithm, implement it using OpenMP and determine the 
speed-up achieved.
12. Implement N Queen's problem using Back Tracking.
