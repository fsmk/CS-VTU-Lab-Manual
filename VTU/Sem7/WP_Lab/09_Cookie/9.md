     	#calculate 60 days in the future: seconds * minutes * hours * days + current time
     	$itm=60*60*24*60+time();
     	#create cookie
     	setcookie('last_visit',date("G:i -m/d/y"),$itm);
     	#check if cookie exists
     	if(isset($_COOKIE['last_visit'])){
     		$visit=$_COOKIE['last_visit'];
			echo "Your last visit was- " .$visit;
     	}
     	else{
          	#no cookies
     		echo "You have some stale cookies!" ;
          }
     ?>
