*9.php*

     <?php
     	#calculate 60 days in the future: seconds * minutes * hours * days + current time
     	$itm=60*60*24*60+time();
     	#create cookie
     	setcookie('last_visit',date("G:i -m/d/y"),$itm);
     	#check if cookie exists
        if(isset($_COOKIE['last_visit'])) {
            $visit=$_COOKIE['last_visit'];
            echo "Your last visit was- " .$visit;
        }
        else {
            #no cookies
            echo "You have some stale cookies!" ;
        }
     ?>
