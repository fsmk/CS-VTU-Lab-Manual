##About Free Software Movement Karnataka (FSMK)

Free Software Movement Karnataka (FSMK) is a non­profit organization
formed in March 2009 to spread the ideals of free software. We try to increase the understanding of the philosophy behind free software and encourage its use in educational institutions, our very own community center and other organisations.

The phrase “free and open source software” can be used to collectively describe a set of operating systems and standalone applications that are free from the clutches of large corporate organisations which produce software only for commercial purposes. Free software is often freelyavailable and is created by a thriving community of programmers, designers and writers. The source code(i.e, the computer program) that underlies an application or an operating system is also open to the perusal of the common individual, which allows every curious tinkerer, student orotherwise, to play around with the source code.Most free software organisations welcome the general public to be part of their community and to contribute in any of the three spheres mentioned above.  In the event of you not being a programmer, designer or writer, you can also become a member of the community by actively using free software applications, thereby reporting any issues that you notice, and also by spreading awareness about free software among your friends and family.At FSMK, we believe that it is unfortunate that schools, colleges and other small organisations that can use Linux and related free software for no cost, instead invest in using proprietary and commercial software, thereby spending large amounts annually on licensing and other fees, which can instead be used for the betterment of education or related services, and
thereby, the betterment of society.
