## Aim: Program to implement the Cohen-Sutherland line-clipping algorithm. Make provision to specify the input line, window for clipping and view port for displaying the clipped image.

## Algorithm:
1. End-points pairs are check for trivial acceptance or trivial rejected using the outcode.
2. If not trivial-accepance or trivial-rejected, divided into two segments at a clip edge.
3. Iteratively clipped by testing trivial-acceptance or trivial-rejected, and divided into two segments until completely 	inside or trivial-rejected.
4. To perform trivial accept and reject tests, we extend the edges of the clip rectangle to divide the plane of the clip rectangle into nine regions. Each region is assigned a 4-bit code deteermined by where the region lies with respect to the outside halfplanes of the clip-rectangle edges. Each bit in the outcode is set to either 1 (true) or 0 (false); the 4 bits in the code correspond to the following conditions:
	* Bit 1 : outside halfplane of top edge, above top edge
Y > Ymax
	* Bit 2 : outside halfplane of bottom edge, below bottom edge
Y < Ymin
	* Bit 3 : outside halfplane of right edge, to the right of right edge
X > Xmax
	* Bit 4 : outside halfplane of left edge, to the left of left edge
X < Xmin 

## Theory
> In computer graphics, 'line clipping' is the process of removing lines or portions of lines outside of an area of interest. Typically, any line or part thereof which is outside of the viewing area is removed.
> The Cohenï¿½Sutherland algorithm is a computer graphics algorithm used for line clipping. The algorithm divides a two-dimensional space into 9 regions (or a three-dimensional space into 27 regions), and then efficiently determines the lines and portions of lines that are visible in the center region of interest (the viewport).
> The algorithm quickly detects and dispenses with two common and trivial cases. To clip a line, we need to consider only its endpoints. If both endpoints of a line lie inside the window, the entire line lies inside the window. It is trivially accepted and needs no clipping. On the other hand, if both endpoints of a line lie entirely to one side of the window, the line must lie entirely outside of the window. It is trivially rejected and needs to be neither clipped nor displayed.
